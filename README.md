#Pacmutt
Yet another Nuget package manager
> because managing nuget packages is a b*tch!

## Todo list
- [ ] There is an error after I install this.  It installs fine, but running it as `pacmutt` throws a error related to nuget and something about access.  The error links me to installing net8, but it's already installed!  Dunno what to make of it, but my guess would be to either dual-installed .net7 and run this CLI in net7, multitarget to net7, or wait for a patch.
- [ ] Use the myget feed api to find the latest packages.
